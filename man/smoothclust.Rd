  input,
  method = c("uniform", "kernel"),

}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Input data, assumed to be provided as \code{SpatialExperiment}
object containing spatial coordinates in \code{spatialCoords} slot and
expression counts (raw or transformed) in \code{assays} slot.}

\item{method}{Method used for smoothing. The \code{uniform} method calculates
unweighted averages across spatial locations within a circular window with
radius \code{bandwidth} at each spatial location, which smooths out spatial
variability as well as sparsity due to sampling variability. The
\code{kernel} method calculates a weighted average using a truncated
exponential kernel applied to Euclidean distances with a length scale
parameter equal to \code{bandwidth}, which provides a more sophisticated
approach to smoothing out spatial variability but may be affected by
sparsity due to sampling variability (especially sparsity at the index
point), and is computationally slower. Default = \code{uniform}.}

\item{assay_name}{Name of \code{assay} in input object containing expression
count values to be smoothed. Usually this will be either \code{counts} (raw
counts) or \code{logcounts} (log-transformed normalized counts). We
recommend using raw counts (\code{counts}) if available, in which case the
methodology will apply smoothing to the raw counts and then calculate
logcounts. Alternatively, logcounts (\code{logcounts}) may also be used as
the input, in which case the smoothed values represent geometric averages,
which are more difficult to interpret. Default = \code{counts}.}

\item{bandwidth}{Bandwidth parameter for smoothing, expressed as proportion
of width or height (whichever is greater) of tissue area. Smoothing is
performed across neighboring values at each point. For \code{method =
"uniform"}, the bandwidth represents the radius of a circle, and unweighted
averages are calculated across points within this circle. For \code{method
= "kernel"}, the averaging is weighted by distances scaled using a
truncated exponential kernel applied to Euclidean distances. For example, a
bandwidth of 0.05 will smooth values across neighbors weighted by distances
scaled using a truncated exponential kernel with length scale equal to 5%
of the width or height (whichever is greater) of the tissue area. Weights
for \code{method = "kernel"} are truncated at small values for
computational efficiency. Default = 0.05.}

\item{truncate}{Truncation threshold parameter if \code{method = "kernel"}.
Kernel weights below this value are set to zero for computational
efficiency. Only used for \code{method = "kernel"}. Default = 0.05.}

\item{assay_name_smooth}{Name of assay to store smoothed values. Default =
\code{counts_smooth}. Alternatively, set to \code{logcounts_smooth} if
logcounts were provided instead of raw counts for the input values.}

\item{calc_logcounts}{Whether to calculate logcounts using smoothed values of
raw counts and store these in new assay named \code{logcounts_smooth} in
output object. Uses methods from \code{scran} package to calculate
normalization and log-transformation. Default = TRUE.}
}
\value{
Returns the \code{SpatialExperiment} object with new assays (default
  names \code{counts_smooth} and \code{logcounts_smooth}) containing
  spatially smoothed expression values, which can be used as the input for
  further downstream analyses such as clustering.
}
\description{
Spatial clustering algorithm for spatial transcriptomics data.
}
\details{
Spatial clustering algorithm for spatial transcriptomics data based on the
principle of smoothing expression measurements across neighboring spatial
locations. The algorithm can be used to define spatial domains consisting of
a single cell type or a consistent mixture of cell types with smooth spatial
boundaries.
