Package: smoothclust
Version: 0.0.1
Title: smoothclust
Description: Spatial clustering algorithm for spatial transcriptomics data 
    based on smoothing expression measurements across neighboring spatial 
    locations. The algorithm can be used to define spatial domains consisting 
    of a consistent mixture of cell types with smooth spatial boundaries.
