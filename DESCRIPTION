Package: smoothclust
Version: 0.99.0
Title: smoothclust
Description: Method for segmentation of spatial domains and spatially-aware 
    clustering in spatial transcriptomics data. The method generates spatial 
    domains with smooth boundaries by smoothing gene expression profiles across 
    neighboring spatial locations, followed by unsupervised clustering. Spatial 
    domains consisting of consistent mixtures of cell types may then be further 
    investigated by applying cell type compositional analyses or differential 
    analyses.
