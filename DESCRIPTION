Package: smoothclust
Version: 0.0.1
Title: smoothclust
Description: Spatial clustering algorithm for spatial transcriptomics data 
    based on the principle of smoothing expression measurements across 
    neighboring spatial locations. The algorithm can be used to define spatial 
    domains consisting of a single cell type or a consistent mixture of cell 
    types with smooth spatial boundaries.
